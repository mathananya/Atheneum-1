Atheneum (meaning : the temple of Athena - Greek Goddess of
            Knowledge) is a not-for profit startup in the education industry.
            One of the newest ideas of our time, Atheneum allows students all
            over the country from all backgrounds to donate and receive (free)
            books in a 10 Km radius. Partnering with third party delivery
            companies, Atheneum will ensure a smooth delivery process, even in
            the most remote areas at minimal costs. Itâ€™s presence in North India
            will be the first of its kind. With a very low delivery fee,
            Atheneum will deliver books of all kind and even reference material,
            making it affordable for everyone. This revolutionary idea, will
            solve several real-world problems.
